# ToolboxLS-Manual
[ToolboxLS (the Level Set Methods Toolbox by Ian Mitchell)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mitchell/ToolboxLS/) manual, remastered in `Typst`.

> [!NOTE]
> Why remastering?
> Because the original manual PDF uses unrecognizable fonts, and the text cannot be copied, annotated or edited properly.

> [!CAUTION]
> To myself: 
> `Typst` is still experimental and anti-humanity, DO NOT USE in my next project.

## Usage
Please see [Releases](./releases) for remastered compiled documents.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The full version will not be public before its copyright clarification.

## Progress
- [x] Original edition `en-US`
- [ ] Translation edition `zh-CN`
